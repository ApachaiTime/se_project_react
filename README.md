# WTWR (What To Wear?)

WTWR (What To Wear?) is a full‑stack web application that automatically recommends outfits based on real‑time weather conditions. By detecting the user’s location and pulling current temperature data, the app delivers clothing suggestions that help users stay comfortable and weather‑appropriate without any manual input.

This project was built to demonstrate a complete, production‑style workflow—from frontend UX and responsiveness to backend architecture, authentication, and data validation.
